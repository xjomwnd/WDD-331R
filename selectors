<h2>Types of Selectors</h2>
<p>
The universal selector (*) is a simple selector.
So are type (or element) selectors such as p and pseudo-element selectors such as ::first-letter.
Compound selectors, such as p:last-child or .message.error, are a sequence of simple selectors that reflect a set of simultaneous conditions to meet when applying rules to an element.

Combinator selectors express a relationship between elements. There are four:
	• the descendant combinator, as in article p
	• the child combinator (>), as in .sidebar > h2
	• the adjacent sibling combinator (+), as in ul + p
	• the general sibling combinator (~), as in p ~ figure
