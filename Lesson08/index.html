    <h2>Types of Selectors</h2>
    <p>
    The universal selector (*) is a simple selector.
    So are type (or element) selectors such as p and pseudo-element selectors such as ::first-letter.
    Compound selectors, such as p:last-child or .message.error, are a sequence of simple selectors that reflect a set of simultaneous conditions to meet when applying rules to an element. 
    
    <ul>
    Combinator selectors express a relationship between elements. There are four:
    <li>the descendant combinator, as in article p</li>
    <li>the child combinator (>), as in .sidebar > h2</li>
    <li>the adjacent sibling combinator (+), as in ul + p</li>
    <li>the general sibling combinator (~), as in p ~ figure</li>
    </ul>
